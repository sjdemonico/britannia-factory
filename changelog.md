## [Unreleased] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **QuestManager autoload** — loads quest definitions from `data/quests/quests.json`; tracks per-quest state (active, complete, failed) and per-objective state (hidden, inactive, active, complete, skipped)
- **Quest triggers** — quests start via dialogue keyword (`check_dialogue_triggers`), region entry (`check_region_entry_triggers`), tile step (`check_tile_triggers`), or reading a world object (`_action_read`)
- **Objective types** — `talk`, `kill`, `reach_region`, `reach_location` (with `region_enter` or `tile_step` sub-trigger), and `action` (branch-resolved)
- **Kill objective tracking** — `CombatManager._handle_death` captures each combatant's `npc_id` before `queue_free` and calls `QuestManager._on_npc_died`; `any_of_group` flag matches kills by NPC id prefix (supports NPC groups)
- **Prerequisite and visibility system** — objectives with `prerequisite_id` start hidden or inactive; they activate automatically when the prerequisite completes; `hidden_until_prerequisite` and `initial_status` fields control initial state
- **Quest branches** — `trigger_branch()` sets `triggered_branch_id`, closes competing branches (skipping their unstarted objectives), activates or completes listed objectives, starts a followup quest if specified, and calls `_check_quest_completion`; `auto_trigger` branches fire automatically from `_evaluate_branches` after every `complete_objective`
- **Item-triggered branches** — `quest_branch_trigger` field on item data fires `trigger_branch` after `_action_consume`
- **Dialogue quest delivery** — NPC keyword blocks support a `quest_delivery` dict; `check_deliver_objective` deducts the item from inventory and either triggers a branch (`trigger_branch_id`) or completes a specific objective
- **Quest rewards** — `_distribute_rewards` collects quest-level and triggered-branch rewards; `_apply_reward` handles `experience` (via `CombatManager.grant_experience`), `item` (inventory or tile drop on overweight), and `stat` (via `PlayerStats.modify_stat`)
- **Fail conditions** — `npc_dead` checked in `_on_npc_died`; `time_elapsed` scheduled via `GameTime.schedule` on quest start and cancelled on completion or failure
- **Journal entries** — timestamped entries written to `journal_updates` on objective completion (`"Objective complete: …"`), new objective reveal (ordered quests), and quest resolution
- **`GameTime.get_timestamp_string()`** — returns `"Day N, HH:MM"` using the existing `format_clock()`
- **`QuestManager.get_all_objective_states(quest_id)`** and **`get_journal_updates(quest_id)`** — query API for UI consumers
- **JournalPanel** (`J`) — CanvasLayer panel listing active, completed, and failed quests; up/down cursor navigation skips category headers; Enter expands/collapses a quest to show non-hidden objectives with `[ ]`/`[x]`/`[-]` markers; lower pane shows quest description and timestamped journal log for the selected quest; Escape closes
- **Panel mutual exclusion** — opening the Journal closes the Character panel and vice versa; opening Inventory closes the Journal
- **Panel centering** — all three overlay panels (Character, Journal, Inventory) are now centered over the 864×672 map viewport at uniform 780×600 dimensions
- **`toggle_journal` input action** — bound to `J` (physical_keycode 74)
- **Test quest content** — three quests in `data/quests/quests.json`: `test_quest_01` (The Missing Merchant — branching, kill, delivery), `test_quest_02` (Deliver the Letter — region travel), `test_quest_03` (Goblin Slayer — kill count)
- **New NPCs and items** — `quest_merchant.json` (Tarvo), `bandit_leader.json`; `merchants_ledger.json` with `quest_branch_trigger`; `data/player/player.json` with starting inventory
- **Quest-aware dialogue** — `innkeeper_01` (Olwen) and `quest_merchant` (Tarvo) updated with keyword chains that guide the player through `test_quest_01`

### Changed

- `complete_objective` posts `"Objective complete: …"` to the message log and writes a timestamped journal entry; ordered quests also post and journal the next revealed objective
- `_check_quest_completion` posts `"Quest complete: …"` and writes a journal entry; repeatable quests erase their state to allow restart
- `start_quest` posts `"New quest: …"` to the message log
- `InventoryScreen` panel resized from 520×400 to 780×600 and repositioned to center over the map viewport

## [Unreleased] — 2026-06-07

### Added

- `Constants.tile_to_world()` static helper; all callers (Player, NPC, WorldObject, CombatArena, CombatManager) updated and local copies deleted
- `Constants.natural_list()` static helper; local copy in Player deleted, InventoryScreen updated
- `Constants.apply_camera_limits()` static helper; applied in Town, Wilderness, and CombatArena, replacing 12 inline `cam.limit_*` assignments
- `Constants.load_json()` static helper for uniform JSON loading
- Eight new string constants: `MODIFIER_REGISTRY_PATH`, `NPC_SCENE_PATH`, `WORLD_OBJECT_SCENE_PATH`, `LOOK_DESCRIPTION_LAYER`, `EXPERIENCE_STAT_ID`, `SPRITE_CORPSE_PATH`, `SPRITE_CARRIABLE_PATH`, `SPRITE_NONCARRIABLE_PATH`
- `GameManager.configure_spawns()` public API; RegionLoader now calls it instead of mutating `_spawn_points`/`_default_spawn` directly
- `GameManager._REGION_SCENE_PATHS` const dictionary replacing runtime string-building in `_region_id_to_scene_path()`
- `Combatant.get_weapon_range()` and `Combatant.get_equipped_weapon()` — canonical implementations on the class that owns the data; private copies in CombatManager, CombatResolver, and CombatAI deleted
- Player attack input (`_on_attack()`, `_resolve_attack()`) added to Player.gd with directional prompt
- `ClockDisplay` change-guard: `_on_tick_advanced` now skips `_update_display()` when hour, minute, day, month, and year are all unchanged
- Weight-limit check in `Inventory.move_to_container()`, matching the guard already present in `add_to_container()`
- Null check for `$Sprite2D` in WorldObject before setting texture
- `object_id` field added to `portal.json` and `town_marker.json` (all 24 object data files now carry the field)

### Changed

- `WorldState.is_tile_occupied_by_npc()` and `get_npc_at_tile()` rewritten to query `tile_occupants` directly; stale-node eviction preserved
- All hardcoded string literals and scene paths replaced with the new `Constants.*` fields throughout Player, StatBlock, PlayerStats, CharacterPanel, InventoryScreen, Town, Wilderness, CombatArena, RegionLoader, and GameManager
- `LineOfSight.has_line_of_sight()` now uses `WorldState.get_objects_at()` (O(1) dict lookup) instead of `GameManager.get_objects_at()` (O(n) child scan)
- NPC JSON files `guard_01.json`, `innkeeper_01.json`, `goblins.json` updated with `hostile`, `experience_value`, and `corpse_name` fields
- Seven equipment JSON files (`boots_leather`, `helmet_leather`, `ring_gold`, `ring_silver`, `shield_wooden`, `sword_iron`, `sword_twohanded`) rewritten with complete schema, including the `type` field required by combat variable resolution

### Fixed

- `GameManager.is_tile_transparent()` was using `tile_data.get_collision_polygons_count(0) > 0`, which always returns 0 for procedurally-built tiles, making all terrain transparent to line-of-sight and talk checks. Now delegates to `tile_registry.is_transparent(type_id)`
- `GameManager.is_tile_passable()` null-guards `tile_registry` before calling `is_passable()`, preventing a crash during scene load before the registry is ready
- Attack input and F9 debug XP cheat removed from `GameManager._unhandled_input`; attack input lives in Player, debug cheat is gone entirely

### Removed

- `WorldState._npc_by_tile` dictionary and `register_npc_tile()` / `unregister_npc_tile()` methods; all call sites in NPC.gd (×6) and CombatManager.gd (×4) removed
- Dead methods: `GameTime.format_clock_line()`, `WorldState.clear_item_tile()`, `WorldState.is_tile_blocked_by_object()`, `WorldState.clear_npc_registry()`
- Hardcoded `_NPC_SCENE` and `_WORLD_OBJECT_SCENE` local constants from CombatArena and RegionLoader
- Private `_get_weapon_range()` and `_get_equipped_weapon()` / `_get_player_weapon_range()` copies from CombatManager, CombatResolver, and CombatAI
